# Car Parking Space Counter using openCV

This project is a car parking space counter that utilizes computer vision techniques to count the number of available parking spaces in an image or a video.

## Introduction

The Car Parking Space Counter is designed to automate the process of counting available parking spaces. It can be used in various scenarios, such as parking lot management, traffic monitoring, and smart city applications. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze images or videos and provide accurate counts of the parking spaces.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/morteza-sharifi1/car-parking-space-counter.git

1- Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install them:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To count parking spaces in an image, you can use the **main.py** script. Here's an example usage:
python main.py --image carparkImg.png

To count parking spaces in a video, you can use the same **main.py** script. Here's an example usage:
python main.py --video park.mp4

The parkingspacepicker.py script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manually label parking spaces in an image. It can be used to create ground truth data for training or evaluation purposes.
